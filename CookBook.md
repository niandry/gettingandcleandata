# CookBook

This code book summarizes the variables and summaries calculated. To run the code, please update the line number 9 with the path where the dataset was dowloaded.

# Input/Output datasets

* testsubject - contain the data from subject_train.txt file
* trainset - contain the data from X_train.txt
* trainlabel - contain data from Y_train.txt
* traindata - compiled trained data
* testsubject - contain the data from subject_test.txt file
* trainset - contain the data from X_test.txt
* trainlabel - contain data from Y_test.txt
* traindata - compiled test data
* alldata - test and trained data compiledin a single dataset
* finaldata - summarized dataset with mean of eachvariable by activity and subjec.
